# Mini Project: Story Generator Using Function

# Objective:
# Create an interactive story generator where users input choices, and the program generates a unique short story based on those choices.

# How It Works:
# The user selects a character (e.g., Detective, Scientist, or Explorer).
# The user selects a location (e.g., Forest, Space, or Ancient Ruins).
# The program generates a random event that happens in the story.
# Based on these inputs, a custom story is displayed.

# Functions to Implement:
# choose_character() → Lets the user pick a character.
# choose_location() → Lets the user pick a setting.
# generate_event() → Randomly selects an event (e.g., "finds a secret map" or "meets an alien").
# create_story(character, location, event) → Generates a short story using the inputs.
# start_story_generator() → Controls the flow of the program.
